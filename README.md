I used Kaggle's Global Terrorism Dataset to create an informative Power BI dashboard. The goal was to analyze global terrorism trends through visuals, focusing on success rates and patterns.

The project began by importing the raw data from the Kaggle dataset into Power BI. The dataset contained a wealth of information on terrorist attacks spanning different countries, regions, target types, attack types, and more. To prepare the data for visualization, a series of data transformations were conducted within Power Query Editor, ensuring that the data was clean, structured, and ready for analysis.

The heart of the project was the creation of a sophisticated and interactive dashboard, carefully designed to address the specified objectives. Each objective was transformed into a dynamic visualization to provide clear insights into global terrorism trends:

1) Success Rate by Type of Attacks: A visual breakdown of success rates across different attack types, shedding light on the effectiveness of various strategies employed by terrorist groups.

2) Success Rate by Target Type: An intuitive visualization showcasing the success rates of attacks based on the nature of the targets, revealing patterns and vulnerabilities.

3) Success Rate by Weapon Type: A graphical representation of success rates attributed to different weapon types, offering insights into the lethality of specific weaponry.

4) Success Rate by Country: An interactive map displaying success rates across various countries, revealing areas of heightened terrorist activity.

5) Success Rate by Region: A regional analysis illustrating the success rates of attacks in different parts of the world, providing a global perspective.

6) Success Rate by Name of Group: A visualization depicting the success rates of attacks carried out by different terrorist groups, highlighting their varying impact.

7) Total Attacks by Year: A timeline visualization showcasing the frequency of attacks over the years, enabling the identification of long-term trends.

8) To enhance user interactivity and customization, a slicer was incorporated, enabling users to filter the dashboard by country, thereby tailoring the analysis to specific regions of interest.

In addition, four insightful cards were integrated into the dashboard:
i) Most Used Weapon: Displaying the weapon type most frequently employed in attacks.
ii) Total Targets: Showing the overall count of distinct target types.
iii) Maximum Attacks: Identifying the peak count of attacks within the dataset.
iv) Most Deadly Group: Highlighting the terrorist group associated with the highest number of casualties.

The result is a visually compelling and informative Power BI dashboard that provides a comprehensive overview of global terrorism trends, facilitating data-driven decision-making and fostering a deeper understanding of this critical issue. The project underscores the power of data visualization in revealing complex patterns and insights that might otherwise remain hidden within vast datasets.
